This project refers to an exercise listed in the classic textbook _The Elements of Statistical Learning_ by T. Hastie, R. Tibshirani, and J. Friedman. The data set concerns handwritten number recognition. The pictures were scanned and transformed into 256 numbers representing the information of grey level. More details about the data can be found on the website of the book.

Our goal here is to treat it as a starting multiclass classification problem and practice the application of K-Nearest Neighbors approach and Logistic classification.

The code and the bulk of the project can be found in the Jupyter notebook.
